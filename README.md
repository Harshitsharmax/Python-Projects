# Python Programs Repository 

This repository contains a collection of Python programs that I have developed. Each program serves a specific purpose and can be used for various tasks. Here's a brief overview of what's included:

1.  Text to Speech Converter: Converts text into speech using the pyttsx3 library.
2.  Weather Telling Program: Retrieves and displays weather information for a given location using the requests, JSON, and pyttsx3 library.
3.  Image Resizer: Resizes images to a specified width and height using the cv2 library.
4.  PDF Merger Program: Merges multiple PDF files into a single PDF file using the PyPDF2 library.
5.  Face Recognition Attendance System: A moderate-level program that uses face recognition to record attendance. It uses the face recognition library for face       recognition and attendance management.

Feel free to explore each program and use them as needed. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
